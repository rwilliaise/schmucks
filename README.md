Adds little people that look vaguely like you.

## TODO

- [ ] Have Schmucks throw TNT
    - [ ] Maybe a specific depletable TNT bomb
        - [ ] Create depletion of resources for Schmucks
    - [ ] Optionally planting TNT and detonating
- [ ] Make Schmucks create bases
    - [ ] Detection for existing bases (maybe village code w/ doors)
    - [ ] Strategic placement
        - [ ] Maybe something from the TargetFinder class
- [ ] Make Schmucks have finer tuned control
    - [x] Right click a Schmuck to only affect them, GUI option to affect tag
    - [x] Custom Radius or search for Schmucks
    - [x] A "tag" feature where some Schmucks are colored
        - [x] For example "lime start teleporting"
    - [x] Blacklist for furnaces/chests to drop off into
        - [ ] Right click on a chest to adjust which tags can place into it
    - [ ] Forcefully make a Schmuck or tag be a certain job
    - [ ] Seperate Schmucks by tag (flee from each other)
