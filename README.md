# Schmucks

Adds little people that look vaguely like you.

## TODO
- [x] Tabs will be created for each root 
  - [ ] 
  - [ ] Subtabs (hunter, gatherer, general) 6/29
    - [ ] Subtabs should be on the bottom, and show a specialization icon from the registry 6/29
    - [ ] Decide if the root node of the tree should be hidden (the actual tab node) 6/29
    - [ ] Add specialization points
      - [ ] Create specialization points per root
        - [ ] Create advancements that give specialization points
          - [ ] Use the advancement awards system to award points
        - [ ] Also award points when a schmuck does a given task
          - [ ] Kill a mob - 2 points
          - [ ] Mine an ore/log - 1 point
          - [ ] Smelt ore/food - 3 points
          - [ ] Harvest crop - 1 points
          - [ ] Brainstorm more
- [x] Import the gladiator specialization hat
    - [x] Find way to make blockbench model an entity model instead of block/item
    - [x] Create a future process for importing hats
    - [x] If possible, forge -> fabric
    - [x] Also could manually take the model and just write it up as a .java
- [x] Read levels from nbt and load the specializations for them. SpecializationsImpl.java - 6/24
    - [x] Sync after reading, or something along those lines
    - [x] Also make sure that the client is up to date with the level info
    - [x] Find a way to sync data similar to PlayerAdvancementTracker but with components
        - [x] This is already half done, but I would like it to be fleshed out
- [ ] Start on the first few modifiers/specializations(20 specializations)
    - [x] First spec: snug boots
        - [x] Create a way to modify the speed of an entity
        - [x] Look at the speed status effect
    - [x] Second spec: mollify
        - [x] Find a way for creepers to ignore Schmucks
        - [x] Also make a way for the creepers to know if the Schmucks actually have the specialization
            - [x] Possibly create a specific method in SchmuckEntity.java that gets if a given modifier has been applied
    - [x] Third spec: Constitution
        - [x] Look at the status effect that gives you extra health
    - [x] Find a way to bind custom events to their AI, for example a speed spec increases the speed on given goals
        - [x] Modifiers already have a .apply(), however this does not really interface with any goals or attributes.
        - [x] As well, modifiers aren't loaded from anywhere.
- [x] Import the rest of the icons, add them to atlas - 6/24
    - [x] Also add them to the datapack specialization files
- [ ] ~~Find a way to make atlas code not use mixins to load (low priority)~~
    - [ ] ~~CLIENT_DATA does not work, have to use mixins to load atlas~~
    - [ ] ~~Primary reason being that the atlas loader will need the gl context before the context is even created, which causes a crash~~
- [ ] ~~Age loader~~
    - [ ] ~~Add an ages set to the specialization manager~~
    - [ ] ~~Seperate method in the ServerSpecializationLoader~~
- [x] Send sync packets automatically, detect if the specialization component is dirty
    - [x] Utilize .serverTick() to sync when dirty
    - [x] Also could add .putLevel() to manually set dirtiness
- [ ] Replace the shift right-click with a normal right-click with the Schmuck Staff
    - [ ] See raycast result to see if the right-click should be processed
- [x] Redo the graphics for the Schmuck staff - Chris - 6/25
    - [x] If the angle has been edited, edit the model from /handheld to /generated
    - [x] If it has been flipped, find a way to flip the /handheld or just mess with the display obj
- [ ] Add tabs to the Schmuck Staff UI
    - [ ] Dashboard tab, move current UI into
    - [ ] Specializations tab, copy and paste the advancements UI and fit it over the specializations
        - [ ] Handle ages
            - [ ] Fog of war that covers the specializations when the age is not acquired
                - [ ] Find out how to do shaders
                - [ ] If shaders aren't possible, just a black fog with a texture
            - [ ] Ages should have a little text blurb with a hint what it is
            - [ ] If the player has all ages it should show a "new age coming soon"
            - [ ] Ages should automatically find the first element that is part of an age, and get the x and hide that.

- [ ] ~~Have Schmucks throw TNT~~
    - [ ] ~~Maybe a specific depletable TNT bomb~~
        - [ ] ~~Create depletion of resources for Schmucks~~
    - [ ] ~~Optionally planting TNT and detonating~~
- [ ] ~~Make Schmucks create bases~~
    - [ ] ~~Detection for existing bases (maybe village code w/ doors)~~
    - [ ] ~~Strategic placement~~
        - [ ] ~~Maybe something from the TargetFinder class~~
- [ ] Make Schmucks have finer tuned control
    - [x] Right click a Schmuck to only affect them, GUI option to affect tag
    - [x] Custom Radius or search for Schmucks
    - [x] A "tag" feature where some Schmucks are colored
        - [x] For example "lime start teleporting"
    - [x] Blacklist for furnaces/chests to drop off into
        - [ ] Right click on a chest to adjust which tags can place into it
    - [ ] Forcefully make a Schmuck or tag be a certain job
    - [ ] Seperate Schmucks by tag (flee from each other)
